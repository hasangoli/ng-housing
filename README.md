# Angular Housing Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1

## Development server

Before everything just install json-server as global with this code:

``` 
npm i -g json-server
```

Then run:
```
ng serve -o
```
This code will automatically open `localhost:4200` in your default browser.
